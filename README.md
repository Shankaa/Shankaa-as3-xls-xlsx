This is my fork of as3xls — an Excel library for Actionscript 3. 
It supports:
big XLS files (extended FAT)
XLSX files (in a simplified form, no function, no format only raw data).
The coworker framework

This fork must include AS3commons-zip-1.0.0 library for the support of ooxml files (xlsx files)
